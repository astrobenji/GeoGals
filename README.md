# GeoGals
A publicly available repository for using geostatistical methods on real and simulated galaxy data.

This package contains functions that enable a user to:

 * Create a semivariogram for real or simulated spatial galaxy data
 * Fit geostatistical models to galaxy data that accounts for a spatially-varying mean, as well as small-scale fluctuations
 * Use kriging to predict values of random fields at observed/unobserved locations
