# GeoGals
A publicly available repository for using geostatistical methods on real and simulated galaxy data.

This package contains functions that enable a user to:

 * Create a semivariogram for real or simulated spatial galaxy data.
 * Fit geostatistical models to galaxy data that account for a spatially-varying mean, as well as small-scale fluctuations.
 * Use kriging to predict values of random fields at observed/unobserved locations.

The best way to get started with this package is to head over to the [tutorials](https://github.com/astrobenji/GeoGals/tree/main/docs/tutorials). Further documentation is available on [readthedocs](https://geogals.readthedocs.io/). For additional support, please do not hesitate to contact Benji Metha (methab ((at)) student.unimelb.edu.au).
